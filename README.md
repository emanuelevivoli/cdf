# The Comics Datasets Framework

Framework for mixing Comics datasets, existing and new, with dense and curated annotations.

## Structure
In the main repository, there will be released:
- [ ] instruction to get the datasets (DCM772, comics100, PopManga, eBDtheque, Manga109)
- [ ] main code for unifying existing annotations
- [ ] converters to UCA
- [ ] converters to/from CVAT, COCO, YOLO

As part of the following code, we will release:
- [ ] detection annotations (for train split) for the above datasets (curated by authors)
- [ ] code and weights for Faster R-CNN, YOLO finetuned models
- [ ] code to evaluate the above models, and the existing Magi, DASS, and GroundingDINO
- [ ] evaluation server for performance evaluation :)
